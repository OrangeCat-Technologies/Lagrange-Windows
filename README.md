# Lagrange - Windows Installation Guide

Welcome to Lagrange! Follow these steps to install and run the application on your system.

## Step 1: Download and Extract
1. Download the provided `.zip` file for Lagrange
2. Extract the contents to a location of your choice

**Note**: If `server.exe` is flagged as a virus and automatically removed by antivirus software, disable your antivirus temporarily and extract the file again.

## Step 2: Run the Server
1. Navigate to the extracted folder
2. Locate and double-click `server.exe`
**Note**: These prompts appear only once. Future data storage will use the chosen folders. Settings can be changed in the .env file.

4. If Windows Defender warns:
   - Click "More Info"
   - Select "Run Anyway"
   This opens a CLI with the server running. Do not close this window.

## Step 3: Run the Lagrange Application
1. Find and double-click the Lagrange application file
2. A sample conversation will display
3. Click the `+` button in the left navigation bar to start a new chat

## Important Notes
- Re-enable antivirus after installation if disabled
- Keep server CLI open while using the application
- All the code projects generated by Lagrange will be stored in `C:/Lagrange`
- Feel free to create a Github issue in case you're facing difficulties running the software. This includes any sign-in errors, inference errors, or code generation.

Happy building with Lagrange! ðŸš€
